<title>Media Literacy</title>
</head>

<body><!-- This syllabus is "forked" from, among other syllabi, Frank Moretti's History of Communications class (2003) and John Broughton's Media and Visual Culture class (2005) at Teachers College; Rasmus Kleis Nielsen's stellar first-time-teaching course at Columbia Universty's Journalism School (2008); David Kerr's Investigative Journalism class at Hampshire College (1997); and, in the spirit of critiquing academic research, Ray Coppinger's Animal Behavior class at Hampshire (1995 -- because yes, first-year undergrads can be thrown into the deep end of reading original research and learn from it -- or even, in my case, be profoundly changed by it). And, if I'm doing this right, Lalitha Vasudevan's pedagogy, generally. (There will be Post-Its.) This syllabus also owes debts of gratitude for inspiration to Danielle Kaplan, Renee Hobbs, Matt Curinga, Chuck Kinzer, my Poly teachers Zeva Lahorgue and Roger Ipswitch, the staff of the Media Education Foundation, everyone involved with the HOPE conference, and the MetaFilter community (for schooling me on Charlie Brooker). -->

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Media Literacy is an introduction to the ways media influences its own future as well as our own. This course will help students become more critical of our media environment and more effective communicators of ideas, perspectives, and knowledge. Media Literacy comprises film, television, radio, the Web, and digital games. As both consumers and producers of media, we will analyze and make sense of the myriad ways that media informs, obscures, propagates, sells, and makes whole our sense of individuality and community. Topics include visual signification, digital media, the social functions of the image, and the role of media in the cultural process.</p>
<h2>Goals and objectives</h2>
Students will:
<ul>
    <li>Confront and assess their own preconceived ideas about media, technology, and literacy;</li>
    <li>Distinguish between the affordances of different media;</li>
    <li>Understand relationships between technical and meaning-creating practices;</li>
    <li>Develop a language for media technology and signification;</li>
    <li>Understand how media technologies interact with identity;</li>
    <li>Be able to articulate  cultural and political implications of communication, with     attention to concerns of power and equity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>GRADING</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>A.</strong> An A student is one who, in addition to all the qualities manifested by a B student, seeks mastery of a special field; s/he has initiative and originality in attacking and solving problems; s/he shows ability in rethinking problems,       making associations, and adapting to new and changing situations; moreover, s/ he has an appropriate vocabulary at his or her      command.</li>
    <li><strong>B.</strong> To earn a B grade a student must manifest all the qualities characteristic of a C student and in addition be able to demonstrate  skills beyond  the basic elements of the course; s/he has a more personal grasp of the principles of the course and perceives      wider application of them. The student should be able to discuss the subject matter of the course with ease.</li>
    <li><strong>C.</strong> To earn a C grade a student must be able to demonstrate the basic skills of a course, understand the essential background and materials      of a course, apply the basic principles involved, and express them intelligibly.</li>
    <li><strong>D.</strong> A student who is deficient in some degree in any of the areas that are characteristic of a C grade will earn a D.</li>
    <li><strong>F.</strong> The student has failed to show mastery of the basic subject matter for the course.</li>
</ul>
The grades of A-, B+, B-, C+, C-, D+, D- are used to indicate that a student has shown more or less than the usual competency required  for that grade.
<h2>Disability support</h2>
Students with disabilities who believe they may need  accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the Office  of Special Services at 575-3274, Donnelly Hall 226, or via email at  specserv@marist.edu as soon as possible to better ensure that such  accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.
<h2>Cell Phone Policy</h2>
<p>To help you and everyone around you concentrate, cell phone ringers and vibrations are to remain OFF during class, as they would in a professional office. Please refrain from texting, calling, or answering texts or calls in class.</p>
<h2>ATTENDANCE POLICY</h2>
<p>Attendance and punctuality are required.  It is each student&rsquo;s responsibility to sign the attendance sheet during every    class. <strong>Failure to sign the sheet will result in an absence being recorded for that day.</strong> If someone else signs in for    you, you will both lose three points from your final grade.  If the person who signs in for you admits to her/his misdeed,    then only one point will be deducted from your grade and her/his grade.</p>
<p>Every student will be allowed to miss two classes    for any reason without a penalty.  There are no excused or unexcused absences.<strong> Every absence after the first two    absences will result in three points being deducted from the student&rsquo;s final grade.</strong></p>
<p>Arriving late and/or leaving early is unacceptable.  You miss out on what we're learning, and it distracts all of us.     Do not arrive late to class or leave class early. <strong>Every tardy or early departure will result in one point being deducted from your final grade. </strong></p>
<h2>How to Do Well in This Class</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Attend all classes and participate constructively, i.e. answer      questions, ask questions, and offer helpful suggestions for others&rsquo;      works.</li>
    <li>Do not cheat on any assignment.</li>
    <li>Do not spam the instructor with any kind of communication, be it voice, text, video, or direct messages in Second Life. (Particularly not direct messages in Second Life, I'm almost never there anymore.)</li>
</ul>

              From &quot;The Seven Great Debates in the Media Literacy Movement&quot; (Renee Hobbs, 1998:</p>
<p>&quot;At the 1993 Media Literacy National Leadership Conference, U.S. educators could not agree on the range of appropriate goals for media education, or the scope of appropriate instructional techniques, but they did identify the following concepts, based on models developed by British, Australian and Canadian <br />
          educators that should be included in the analysis of media messages: 
      <ol><li>
              media messages are constructed </li>
          <li>
              media messages are produced within economic, social, political, historical and aesthetic contexts </li><li>
              the interpretative meaning-making processes involved in message reception consists of an interaction between the reader, the
              text and the culture </li>
              <li>media have are unique 'languages,' characteristics which typify various forms, genres and symbol systems of communication</li>
              <li>media representations play a role in people's understanding of social reality&quot;</li>
              </ol>            <br />
              Match each of Renee Hobbs's outline points to a media theory mentioned in what you've read so far in Introducing Media Studies. There may be more than one theory matched to more than of her numbered points, and vice versa. Send your answers in to me via iLearn.

              <p>One thing that just about all media scholars agree is that the media do not reflect reality &quot;as it is&quot; -- because they are created by people, they always represent some particular take on reality. You may have heard criticism of how media represent women or people of color, or how they glorify criminals... but have you thought about how they represent rich and poor people, people with disabilities, different professions, or sports? In the next few classes we will explore representation, and how it interacts with advertisers' plans to reach audiences.</p>

We transition from discussing how media makers' conceptions of audiences interact with their representations, to discussing how advertising funding shapes those audiences, and ultimately shapes the media we see.</p>

            </strong>We trust news outlets to pick the stories that are important to our lives and report on them accurately. But as with all the other media we have studied, the news is constructed -- it's not just an unaltered reflection of reality. We'll discuss some of the ways that the news is impacted by the shape of the genre, the channels through which we receive it, and decisions made by editors and reporters.<br />

              While computers seem to get &quot;smarter&quot; every year, able to predict what we want before we even know     we want it, beneath the surface layer of interaction they still think like robots. To understand why they do what they do, we may still need to think like robots to communicate well with them and get them to do what we want.

<p><b>What do the &quot;media panics&quot; we're reading about have in common?</b>      Gerbner said &quot;The usual question &ndash; &quot;Does television violence incite real-life violence?&quot; &ndash; is itself a symptom rather than diagnostic tool of the problem.&quot; What might he have said was &quot;the usual question&quot; about medieval writing, the alphabet, comic books, Google, and Sesame Street? What do you think people's concerns about these media products were &quot;symptoms&quot; of?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a id="GEE" name="GEE"></a>Gee definitions exercise (digital worksheet on forum, due Thursday, September 20)</h3>
<p><b>This assignment will probably be easier if you provide examples of something in the media that YOU are a fan of. But if you're uncomfortable sharing, you can describe someone else and the media they are a fan of.</b>   <br />
<b>Copy and paste these questions on the forum. Write your answers between the questions, <em>as full sentences,</em> formatting the questions differently (bold, italic, different color, whatever) and using line spacing to be sure everything is readable.</b></p>
<p>Give me a tour of a SEMIOTIC DOMAIN and an IDENTITY related to a movie, band, show, broadcast event, book, comic, website, game, or other media &quot;text.&quot; Use examples from the Internet.    <br />
What SEMIOTIC DOMAIN are you going to be talking about?    <br />
Link to a site which relates to this semiotic domain.   <br />
Remember that a specific semiotic domain is different from &quot;general knowledge.&quot;</p>
<p>Give me an example of an IDENTITY a person might take on to be a part of this semiotic domain.        <br />
Then give me an example of an IDENTITY that person might have elsewhere in their life which might conflict with their identity in that semiotic domain.      <br />
Why might these two identities conflict?</p>
<p>Give me an example of an AFFINITY GROUP within this semiotic domain.</p>
<p>Link to or post two VISUAL things that you/this person would need to be able to &quot;read&quot; to participate in the literacy specific to this domain. (Be specific: this should either be links to image files like .jpg or .png; if you're linking to a whole page, you need to tell me which visual element you are referring to.)     <br />
For each one:      <br />
What does the &quot;reader&quot; need to know to interpret these visual elements within this specific domain?     <br />
How is the SITUATED MEANING of this visual element different in this domain than in another domain?</p>
<p>Give two examples of DESIGN GRAMMAR elements that you/this person need to know to be LITERATE about this domain.</p>
<p>Link to something which relates to a SOCIAL PRACTICE specific to this domain.      In a couple of sentences, describe this social practice.      <br />
How is the SITUATED MEANING of this social practice seen differently by people who do and do not participate in this domain?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- <h3><a id="MCLUHAN" name="MCLUHAN"></a>Technological determinism (3 page  paper or 5 page script, due Monday, September 17)</h3>
<p>Innis and McLuhan believed that media had certain effects on individuals and society. Which of the &quot;media panics&quot; we read about earlier assume the same or similar effects? Given his critique of Innis's and McLuhan's work, what would Carey say about these panics?</p>
<p>You have three options for writing this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Option 1: write it as a traditional paper; 3 pages.</li>
    <li>Option 2: write it as a script for a five-minute episode of The Media Show, using Weena, Erna, the Intern, and other characters as you see fit; 5 pages.</li>
    <li>Option 3: write it as a script for your own five-minute video; 5 pages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IF YOU ARE WRITING A SCRIPT</strong>: Be sure to specify how you will use visual elements to demonstrate the points you are making. Video is a visual medium; there's no point in using it if you're just going to have someone lecturing to the camera! (Yeah, I know. I am bad at following this advice myself.) See the example script if you need some guidance on how to include visuals.</p>

<!-- <a id="CRITIQUE" name="CRITIQUE"></a>Group scholarly article critique (about 5 pages; draft due Monday, October 1, final paper due 10 pm on Tuesday, October 2)</h3>
<p>This project counts as your midterm (I'm scheduling it a little early so you don't have all your midterms the same week.)</p>
<p><strong>Group 1: </strong>read Kalin 1997 Television, Violence, and Children (pp 1-9 and bibliography)<br />
<strong>Group 2: </strong>read Children and the perceived reality of television (pp 86-96) <br />
<strong>Group 3: </strong>read A Process-PFL Approach to Learning in Video Games (10 pp)<br />
<strong>All groups:</strong> read Ten things wrong with media effects (9 pp)</p>
<p>Monday the 24th: we will set groups in class. You may want to communicate with your group members while doing the reading before the next class.</p>
<p>Thursday the 27th (in class):        <strong>With your group, develop a paper critiquing the article you read, addressing these questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>These articles make scientific claims, using statistics and evidence from experiments. Based on our earlier discussion about truth claims, how valid do you think the claims are?  
      <ul>
        <li>In addition to drawing on the theories we have read so far,<strong> each member of your group should identify one decision made by the researchers as they designed their study</strong> which could compromise their scientific results. Some options might be the number of people studied, the ways they gathered their data, or the way they framed their research question, but other decisions are also fair game. What you're looking for may be in the &quot;methods,&quot;  &quot;methodology,&quot; or &quot;procedure&quot; sections, or parts where the author is asking questions. Be specific. Make a case for why you think the decision undermines what the researchers are claiming.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Think about the theories we have talked about to date -- Gerbner's cultivation theory; Gee and Saussure's semiotic approach to understanding how people &quot;read&quot; media to be part of a community; Prandstraller and her examples of uses and gratifications;  effects theorists like Wertham and others who said media increase violence (and Gauntlett's critique of media effects research); technological determinists like McLuhan and the author writing about Google. Viewing your article through the lens of these theories, what  would these theorists have said about the questions posed by your researchers, or about the assumptions they make? <strong>Each member of your group should contribute a short paragraph about what one theorist would have said about your article's questions and assumptions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Between classes, continue to write your group's critique.</p>
<p>These may be scientific articles, but don't take anything they say at face value. Take their arguments to pieces and make a case for whether or not you think their argument works.</p>
<p>This should be written as an academic paper -- so I shouldn't see &quot;I&quot; or &quot;we.&quot; No first-person, no &quot;this is my opinion&quot; no &quot;I think...&quot; Make your argument based on the evidence.</p> -->

<h3><a id="FAN" name="FAN"></a>Fan production worksheet (due Monday, October 1)</h3>
Online, find an example of fans who have created their own content -- writing, art, video, etc -- based on a mass media property. <br />
Places to start looking for fan works (but anywhere you find it is fine):
<ul>
    <li>DeviantArt</li>
    <li>Know Your Meme</li>
    <li>Fanfiction.net</li>
    <li>TVTropes</li>
    <li>YouTube</li>
</ul>
<p>On the forum, link to it (post it if it is an image, embed it if it is a video).</p>
<p>Briefly say something about what you think the original message of the media property is, as well as the intended original audience. <br />
Describe who you think the new audience of the &quot;repurposed&quot; text is (age? gender? race? class? education level?).       <br />
Answer these questions in your writing:<br />
How have the fans &quot;subverted&quot; the original message, or if you don't think they have, why would you say they have not?       <br />
Think back to Jim Gee's writing on video games and affinity groups, and Prandstraller's article on fans writing about U2. Would you say, like they do, that these fans are &quot;active consumers&quot; who are creating new meanings? Why or why not?</p>
<h3><br />
<a id="NEWOLD" name="NEWOLD"></a>New vs old media assignment (5 page paper or 7 page script, due Thursday, October 11)</h3>
<p>So now we've talked about how digital media differ from traditional conceptions of &quot;mass&quot; media. As Shirky points out, many of our societal assumptions about how the media work are still carried over from the age of mass media. For this assignment, I want you to think about the interactions of new and old media.<br />
Please compare the descriptions of new digital and old mass media from Shirky and McQuail to support your arguments.</p>
<p>Pick one of these topics:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Ideas about how mass media shape the critiques of representation of race, class, gender, ability, and other social groups (&quot;affinity groups&quot;?). In what ways have media environments and audiences changed that requires a change in how we think about who is represented and how in the media? In what ways have things stayed the same? (Please address both questions.)</li>
    <li>Think back to the &quot;media effects&quot; research and critiques we read earlier-- the studies of children and television, and the Gerbner and Gauntlett articles. In a digitally-mediated society, what has changed that supports or detracts from these assumptions about how media influence people? You will want to work off of what Shirky says.</li>
    <li>Mass media and digital media exist side by side these days. Both Shirky and McQuail present claims about the effects of the &quot;shape&quot; of new and old media (the &quot;pipe&quot; or the &quot;channel&quot; through which they get to us, NOT the content. Think back to how the &quot;Is Google Making Us Stupid&quot; article and the mentions of McLuhan's &quot;the medium is the message&quot; in Introducing Media Studies). How are &quot;technological determinist&quot; claims made by Shirky, McQuail, the Google piece, and McLuhan supported by or undermined by the ways new and old media interact?</li>

<p>You have three options for writing this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Option 1: write it as a traditional paper; 5 pages.</li>
    <li>Option 2: write it as a script for a five-minute episode of The Media Show, using Weena, Erna, the Intern, and other characters as you see fit; 7 pages.</li>
    <li>Option 3: write it as a script for your own five-minute video; 7 pages.    </li>
    <li>We are not producing these videos yet! Just work on the script.</li>
    <li>You WILL need to have one script for the end of the semester project, so consider whether you might like to use this one or the next one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IF YOU ARE WRITING A SCRIPT</strong>: Be sure to specify how you will use visual elements to demonstrate the points you are making. Video is a visual medium; there's no point in using it if you're just going to have someone lecturing to the camera! (Yeah, I know. I am bad at following this advice myself.) See the example script if you need some guidance on how to include visuals.</p>

<h3><a id="NAOR" name="NAOR"></a>News, Ads, Representation, Ownership, and Regulation
assignment (5 page paper or 7 page script, due Monday, November 5)</h3>
<p>Pick a term or concept from the readings we have recently done on news, ads, representation, ownership, or regulation. Write a script to explain it to other students. One way you could do this would be as an argument about the topic between two people (like the puppets on The Media Show).<br />
  <br />
  <!-- I don't think this question was as important as I initially thought, so I'm ditching this paper in favor of something else. <a id="BREAKING" name="BREAKING"></a>Shirky and Fallows (3 page paper or 5 page script,  due Thursday, November 1)</h3>
<p>Shirky writes, &quot;in some cases the [technological] change that threatens the profession benefits society... even in these situations the professionals can be relied upon to care more about self-defense than about progress. What was once a service has become a bottleneck.&quot; <br />
Describe three &quot;bottlenecks&quot; in journalism that Fallows described in the 1990s which Shirky says have been addressed by the rise of digital media and their affordances. Discuss whether you think Shirky is correct in concluding that digital reporting has changed these problems.</p>

<h3><br />
<a id="SCREENCAST" name="SCREENCAST"></a>Screencast (due Monday, November 19)</h3>
<p>Using software like <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html">Jing</a>, <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/download/camtasia/default.asp">Camtasia</a>, <a href="http://www.fraps.com/">Fraps</a>, <a href="http://www.solveigmm.com/en/products/hypercam/">HyperCam</a>, or <a href="http://shinywhitebox.com/ishowu-v1/">iShowU</a>, do a walkthrough of a site that you use regularly.</p>
<p>Navigate through and show the following elements of the website, and evaluate the following in your voiceover:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identifying the site. Who is involved in creating, editing, and moderating the content on this site? How do you know? How easy or hard is it to tell? Visit the site About page (if there is one, or talk about the lack of an About page if there isn't.)</li>
    <li>Do a WhoiIs lookup of the site's address, and talk about what you find. Also interpret the site address: what does it tell you about the site?</li>
    <li>Advertising. What does the advertising on this site (or lack of it) tell you about the intended audience for this site? About yourself as an audience?</li>
    <li>Robot-readable elements. Which elements are there more for search engines to read than for human users?</li>
    <li>Privacy features. Do you feel this site adequately considers users' privacy? Why or why not?</li>
    <li>Name conventions. How does this site ask users to identify themselves - with real names? Nicknames? Do they need to give financial or geographic information to sign up?</li>
</ul>
<h3><br />
<a id="FINAL" name="FINAL"></a>Videos, scripts, and storyboards (see due dates on grid above)</h3>
<p>The final project will be producing a 3-5 minute video communicating an idea from the class to other students. You will revise a script you wrote for an earlier assignment for this project. I will meet with each of you to help you plan your ideas, helping make sure they'll satisfy the course requirement and that you're not trying to do something too big for a final project.</p>
<p>As I said earlier:  Be sure to specify in your script how you will use visual elements to demonstrate the points you are making. Video is a visual medium; there's no point in using it if you're just going to have someone lecturing to the camera! (Yeah, I know. I am bad at following this advice myself.) See the example script if you need some guidance on how to include visuals.</p>
<p>In addition to developing a <strong>script</strong> you will also develop a <strong>storyboard</strong> to plan the shots for your video. We will <strong>workshop</strong> both of these in class before the due date. We may also workshop your <strong>rough cuts</strong> so you have a chance to improve your videos before the final presentation.</p>
