<!-- This is my fork of the standard Digital Toolbox syllabus taught at Marist. Many changes still to be made. -->
<h1>Digital Toolbox</h1>
<h2>Dr. Gillian Andrews</h2>
<h2>Key words:</h2>
<p>Adobe Creative Suite, digital skills, digital literacy <br />
  <br />

<h2> Course Description </h2><br />
The Digital Toolbox provides essential skills in digital media applications including developing text, still and moving images, information graphics, and audio files for Web-based presentation for a wide range of communication professions and serves as a foundation for more advanced courses involving Web-based production. Offered Fall and Spring. Three Credits LA.<br />
  <br />
</p>
<h2>Introduction to the Course </h2>
<p><br />
This course addresses technological convergence and the reality that all students must have an introductory knowledge of the production of digital narratives. The Digital Toolbox focuses on the ways in which digital communication tools can be used to support the types of narratives that communication students are likely   to produce (news, magazines, press releases, fictional narratives for small   screens, and so on). It is a designed as a lab-based course, allowing students to   develop a set of basic skills required for the manipulation of sound and image in   digital environments. Students will learn the basics of Illustrator (graphic design   software), Photoshop (photo editing software), InDesign (print and digital   publishing software), Final Cut Pro (video editing software), and Wordpress   (web content management system).  For students of communication, these skills   are essential to basic literacy; without them, they have little hope of success in   their chosen areas of expertise.   </p>
<p>In addition, this course will help to foster media literacy, a primary goal of the   Communication and Media Arts departments. Although this is primarily a “how   to” course, the knowledge of what is behind the production of digital narratives   gives students a glimpse of how editorial and creative decisions shape stories. In   challenging students to reflect on their own decisions, this course will support   our effort to create both ethical producers and informed consumers of narratives,   in whatever form of delivery.  Students in all Communication concentrations –   Advertising, Communication Studies, Interactive Media, Journalism, Public   Relations/Organizational Communication, Radio, TV &amp; Film, and Sports   Communication – need the technological tools associated with digital narratives   for their upper-level courses, internships and jobs.

  <h2>Course Objectives </h2>
  <br />
  This class will introduce students to the basic principles and techniques of digital media. Students will develop a set of basic skills required for the manipulation of sound and image in digital environments. In addition, students will learn the basics of Illustrator (graphic design software), Photoshop (photo editing software), InDesign (print and digital publishing software), Final Cut Pro (video editing software), Audition (audio production software), and Wordpress.com (web content management system). 

  <br />
  <br />
  Students will critique their own and each other’s work in class with the intent to give helpful feedback. There will be many opportunities for improvement. The premise is that one learns more effectively through extensive practice and revising. In addition to lectures and class discussions, small group work and class exercises will be utilized. Specific objectives for students are:
  <ol>
    <li>Understand the role of digital media in a wide range of communication &amp; media arts fields. (Projects) </li>
    <li>Have an essential vocabulary relevant to digital media applications. (Projects) </li>
    <li>Be able to create audio and visual narratives for the Web. (Projects) </li>
    <li>Have a basic understanding of how to use content management systems. (Projects, website) </li>
    <li>Be able to create a digital portfolio integrating all of the skills listed above. (Website) </li>
  </ol>
  Achievement of these outcomes will be assessed through multiple projects and a final presentation. Organization of the Class This class meets twice each week. Each class will be comprised of lecture, discussion and creating. Students should come to class prepared to listen, take notes, create and critique their own and others’ works. As a general rule, class meetings will involve brief instruction on new skills and concepts and then students will immediately apply those concepts within assigned projects.

  <h2> Assignments & Evaluation Policies </h2>
    
  Each student must complete the assignment for the day and come prepared to 
  discuss what you have read and/or created.  Class participation is required.  You 
  must be able to relate what you have read to what you are seeing and discussing in 
  class. 
  <p>To help you develop basic skills, you will complete five projects designed to 
    incorporate the use of digital tools appropriate for websites and web-based 
    storytelling. These are a Magazine Cover, Ideal Dorm Room, Photo Essay, and Mini- 
    Documentary.  Assignments will be introduced in class. You then will be expected to 
    spend time in the lab outside of class time to complete each assignment (assessment 
    of goals 1-4). 
  <p> For your final project, you will develop a coherent and professional-looking Website 
    at Wordpress.com. The criteria for the successful Website will be described in a 
    handout (assessment of goal 5). 
  <p>Websites will be presented to the class during the final week of classes for critique.  
    You will then be allowed to fine tune your site after receiving peer evaluations. A site 
    evaluation handout will be provided (assessment of goals 1-2).   
  <p>In general, you will lose points for every misspelled word, grammar mistake, 
    fragment or run-on sentence, improper punctuation, passive voice, and/or incorrect 
    formatting.  Do not email assignments to the instructor unless it is an emergency. 
  <p> <strong>All assignments are due at 1:00 pm on the duedate.</strong>  Work turned in to the Drop Box 
    after this time will result in 10 points per day being deducted from the earned grade. 
  <p>In order to demonstrate the breadth and depth of their knowledge, students will 
    compile their projects for inclusion in their final project, the website. These samples 
    are class projects that have been polished. After fine tuning each one, save the new 
    clean copy and then include it in your website.  You MUST include new, polished 
    copies of all your projects on your website to receive credit for this assignment.  Your 
    website should incorporate everything you have learned in the class and be an 
    expression of your professional potential.  
  <p>Any work that receives a grade of less than a C may revised within two weeks of the 
    student receiving her/his grade.  The new grade and the old grade will be averaged.  
    If a work receives a grade of less than a C because it was originally turned in after its 
    due date (it was late), it may not be revised. 
  <p>Cheating of any kind in this class will result in you being dropped 
    from the class, a grade of “F” recorded as your final grade, and your name forwarded 
    to the Dean and to the Center for Advising and Academic Services. 
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  <h2>GRADING </h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>A.</strong>  An A student is one who, in addition to all the qualities manifested by a B student, seeks mastery of a special field; s/he has initiative and originality in attacking and solving problems; s/he shows ability in rethinking problems,  
      making associations, and adapting to new and changing situations; moreover, s/ he has an appropriate vocabulary at his or her 
      command. </li>
    <li><strong>B.</strong> To earn a B grade a student must manifest all the qualities characteristic of a C student and in addition be able to demonstrate  skills beyond  the basic elements of the course; s/he has a more personal grasp of the principles of the course and perceives 
      wider application of them. The student should be able to discuss the subject matter of the course with ease.  </li>
    <li><strong>C.</strong>  To earn a C grade a student must be able to demonstrate the basic skills of a course, understand the essential background and materials 
      of a course, apply the basic principles involved, and express them intelligibly.  </li>
    <li><strong>D.</strong>  A student who is deficient in some degree in any of the areas that are characteristic of a C grade will earn a D.  </li>
    <li><strong>F.</strong>  The student has failed to show mastery of the basic subject matter for the course. </li>
  </ul> 
 
The grades of A-, B+, B-, C+, C-, D+, D- are used to indicate that a student has shown more or less than the usual competency required 
for that grade. 

  
  <h2>Disability support</h2>
  Students with disabilities who believe they may need 
accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the Office 
of Special Services at 575-3274, Donnelly Hall 226, or via email at 
specserv@marist.edu as soon as possible to better ensure that such 
accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.


  
  <h2>Cell Phone Policy </h2>
    
  To help you and everyone around you concentrate, cell phone ringers and vibrations are to remain OFF during class, as they would in a professional office. Please refrain from texting, calling, or answering texts or calls in class. 
  <br />(I thought about saying "go ahead and text anyone who can give you technical assistance on an assignment you're having trouble with in lab," because we'll all be giving each other help in class anyway, but for two reasons I think this is a bad idea: one, I don't want to interrupt anyone ELSE'S class, and two, it's important that we share and build on the expertise in this class. Here's a rough priority list of how you should seek help in class:
  <ol>
    <li>Use a knowledgebase (forum, help page, manual) for the software you're using</li>
    <li>Do a Web search for the problem you're having</li>
    <li>Open the question up to the class</li>
    <li>THEN email or otherwise contact your "lifeline" in a way that won't interrupt them.)</li>
  </ol>


  <h2>ATTENDANCE POLICY </h2>
 
  <p>Attendance and punctuality are required.  It is each student’s responsibility to sign the attendance sheet during every 
    class. <strong>Failure to sign the sheet will result in an absence being recorded for that day.</strong> If someone else signs in for 
    you, you will both lose three points from your final grade.  If the person who signs in for you admits to her/his misdeed, 
    then only one point will be deducted from your grade and her/his grade.  Every student will be allowed to miss two classes 
    for any reason without a penalty.  There are no excused or unexcused absences.<strong> Every absence after the first two 
      absences will result in three points being deducted from the student’s final grade.</strong> Attendance will be taken at the 
    beginning of class.  
    
  <p>Arriving late and/or leaving early is unacceptable.  It shortchanges the latecomer or early departer and distracts others.  
    Do not arrive late to class or leave class early.  
    <br />Every tardy or early departure will result in one point being deducted from your final grade.  NO EXCUSES! 
    
    
    
    
  <h2>How to Do Well in This Class </h2>
 
  <ul>
    <li> Attend all classes and participate constructively, i.e. answer 
      questions, ask questions, and offer helpful suggestions for others’ 
      works.</li>
    <li> Complete each tutorial. While you do so, post any questions you may have to the class wiki's &quot;Questions&quot; page, and sharing tips and tricks you have learned on the &quot;Tips and Tricks&quot; page for that particular piece of software.</li>
    <li> Complete each project by discovering what it is you need and 
      want to do, exploring the possibilities, and implementing 
      them in a creative and utilitarian way.  
      
    </li>
    <li> Present your final website to the class with style and on time. 
      
    </li>
    <li> Do not cheat on any assignment. 
      
    </li>
    <li> Do not spam the instructor with any kind of communication, be it voice, text, video, or direct messages in Second Life. (Particularly not direct messages in Second Life, I'm almost never there anymore.)</li>
  </ul>
