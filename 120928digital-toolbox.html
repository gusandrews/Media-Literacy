<h2>Course Description</h2>
<br />
The Digital Toolbox provides essential skills in digital media applications including developing text, still and moving images, information graphics, and audio files for Web-based presentation for a wide range of communication professions and serves as a foundation for more advanced courses involving Web-based production. Offered Fall and Spring.
<h2>Introduction to the Course</h2>
<p><br />
This course addresses technological convergence and the reality that all students must have an introductory knowledge of digital production. The Digital Toolbox focuses on the ways in which digital communication tools can be used to support the types of narratives that communication students are likely   to produce (news, magazines, press releases, fictional narratives for small   screens, and so on). It is a designed as a lab-based course, allowing students to   develop a set of basic skills required for the manipulation of sound and image in   digital environments. Students will learn the basics of Illustrator (graphic design   software), Photoshop (photo editing software), InDesign (print and digital   publishing software), Final Cut Pro (video editing software), and Wordpress   (web content management system).  For students of communication, these skills   are essential to basic literacy; without them, they have little hope of success in   their chosen areas of expertise.</p>
<p>In addition, this course will help to foster media literacy, a primary goal of the   Communication and Media Arts departments. Although this is primarily a &ldquo;how   to&rdquo; course, the knowledge of what is behind the production of digital narratives   gives students a glimpse of how editorial and creative decisions shape digital content. In   challenging students to reflect on their own decisions, this course will support   our effort to create both ethical producers and informed consumers of digital content,   in whatever form of delivery.  Students in all Communication concentrations &ndash;   Advertising, Communication Studies, Interactive Media, Journalism, Public   Relations/Organizational Communication, Radio, TV &amp; Film, and Sports   Communication &ndash; need the technological tools associated with digital content   for their upper-level courses, internships and jobs.</p>

<br />
<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<br />
This class will introduce students to the basic principles and techniques of digital media. Students will develop a set of basic skills required for the manipulation of sound and image in digital environments. In addition, students will learn the basics of Illustrator (graphic design software), Photoshop (photo editing software), InDesign (print and digital publishing software), Final Cut Pro (video editing software), and Wordpress.com (web content management system).     <br />
<br />
Students will critique their own and each other&rsquo;s work in class with the intent to give helpful feedback. There will be many opportunities for improvement. The premise is that one learns more effectively through extensive practice and revising. In addition to lectures and class discussions, small group work and class exercises will be utilized. Specific objectives for students are:
<ol>
    <li>Understand the role of digital media in a wide range of communication &amp; media arts fields. (Projects)</li>
    <li>Have an essential vocabulary relevant to digital media applications. (Projects)</li>
    <li>Be able to create still and moving visual content for the Web. (Projects)</li>
    <li>Have a basic understanding of how to use content management systems. (Projects, website)</li>
    <li>Be able to create a digital portfolio integrating all of the skills listed above. (Website)</li>
</ol>
<p>Achievement of these outcomes will be assessed through multiple projects and a final presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Organization of the Class</h2>
<p>This class meets twice a week. Each class meeting will consist of students working at their own pace, and bringing with them problems they could not solve outside of class using tutorials or discussion with their classmates.</p>

<h2>Assignments &amp; Evaluation Policies: aka How to Do Well in This Class</h2>
To help you develop basic skills, you will complete projects with digital tools used in web development, publishing, advertising, and professional video editing. These are a Magazine Cover, Infographic, Portfolio Animation, and Ad Parody. For the final project, all of these will be posted on your culminating Project Website. Think of this website as part of your resum&eacute; -- it can be the beginning of a professional portfolio that you can show to employers to demonstrate that you know your stuff when it comes to the software we're using. (Of course This Is Not The Last Image/Video/Website You'll Work On&trade;, so don't stress if you're a perfectionist. Just do the best you can for this course. After the course is over you can totally take it down/keep improving it/replace poor-quality projects with better examples of your work/etc.)
<p><strong>Classwork will consist of:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Brief introductions to some basics of the software</li>
    <li>Sharing skills with your peers</li>
    <li>Working on projects</li>
    <li>Workshopping your work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class participation and attendance are required.</strong> ESPECIALLY on workshop days.  You    will be expected to contribute  positive evaluations of your classmates' work (what &quot;works&quot; about the piece for you?), suggestions for other approaches to working with software or aesthetically evaluating a piece (&quot;Have you tried...?&quot; &quot;I had the same problem and here's a trick that worked for me&quot;), and constructive critical evaluations of what could be improved (&quot;I wanted to see more of...&quot; &quot;Did you notice...?&quot;)</p>
<p><strong>During class lab time</strong>, you need to be &quot;on task&quot; working on some element of the project -- not randomly surfing the Web, chatting with people in or out of class about stuff other than the assignment, working on other assignments, etc. If you think you've already finished the basics of an assignment, talk to me about what else you can do to improve it. You can also teach yourself a more advanced skill with the software, document that skill on the class site, and/or help your peers with the basics.</p>
<p><strong>Homework will consist of:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Finding a tutorial
    <ul>
        <li>Sharing the tutorial you found with the class,</li>
        <li>Working through two tutorials yourself -- the one you found, and one shared by someone else in class</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Posting a question about something you didn't understand on iLearn OR</li>
    <li>Posting tips and tricks about something you learned on iLearn.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may seem easy to ignore the tutorial homework, but be aware: <strong>I may call on you in class to demonstrate something</strong> from the tutorial you posted or from the other tutorial you tried out. <strong>This will count towards your grade.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To hand in your assignments</strong>, send them via the Marist Dropbox service. Do not email them to me. You'll find that many of the files are big enough to cause problems with email, anyway -- they might bounce, meaning I won't get them, and then you'll be up a creek.</p>
<p><strong>Assignments must be turned in in two formats:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>the format native to the program we're using (Photoshop .psd, Illustrator, InDesign, Final Cut Pro, and raw HTML/CSS)</li>
    <li>a production image (.jpg or .png for image files, .mp4 or .mov for movies, a posted working website for the final project.</li>
</ol>
This makes it so I can see your work -- what you know about layers, how you have put together your cuts, etc. <strong>This will be considered in your grade. Not turning in the native format file may raise red flags of cheating,</strong> and I may begin investigating whether you have copied your work.
<p><strong>All assignments are due at noon on the due date.</strong>  Work turned in to the Drop Box   after this time will result in 5 points per day being deducted from the earned grade on that project.</p>
<p>A few more tips:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Do not </strong>use the phone, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Tumblr, my blogs, YouTube, or other social networking sites to contact me when you have important questions or updates about class, like if you need to know about your grade or are going to be absent. Also <strong>do not use the class wiki for these emergencies</strong>. (I'm just not likely to notice the message, and I won't be responsible for missing messages on these sites.) <strong>Send email instead.</strong> If you need me to call you back, send along a number where you can be reached and I will do so.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not </strong>spam me with any kind of communication, be it voice, text, video, or direct messages in Second Life. (Particularly not direct messages in Second Life. I'm almost never there anymore. You probably aren't either, because in all honesty who is; I say this as someone who actually worked on it.)</li>
    <li>Visit the class iLearn site. Do it early, do it often. Comment to help your classmates and post tutorials. <strong>This counts toward your grade. </strong>I can see who's been visiting the site and who hasn't, and if you haven't been showing up, I have no way of knowing if you're doing the work. Not only that, but you're not going to know what the assignments are.</li>
</ul>
<h2>GRADING</h2>
<p>Here's how your grade will break down:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Photoshop magazine cover - 20%</li>
    <li>Illustrator infographic - 20%</li>
    <li>Final Cut ad parody, including script, storyboard, and the movie itself - 30%</li>
    <li>Web portfolio, including HTML, CSS, and InDesign - 10%</li>
    <li><strong>Class participation</strong> including posting and commenting on the wiki for homework, your participation in workshop critique, how much you challenge yourself, and how much progress you personally make from what you initially knew how to do when you started the class - 20%</li>
</ul>
Here's what the grades will represent:
<ul>
    <li><strong>A.</strong>  An A student is one who, in addition to all the qualities manifested by a B student, seeks mastery of a special field; s/he has initiative and originality in attacking and solving problems; s/he shows ability in rethinking problems,         making associations, and adapting to new and changing situations; moreover, s/ he has an appropriate vocabulary at his or her        command.</li>
    <li><strong>B.</strong> To earn a B grade a student must manifest all the qualities characteristic of a C student and in addition be able to demonstrate  skills beyond  the basic elements of the course; s/he has a more personal grasp of the principles of the course and perceives        wider application of them. The student should be able to discuss the subject matter of the course with ease.</li>
    <li><strong>C.</strong>  To earn a C grade a student must be able to demonstrate the basic skills of a course, understand the essential background and materials        of a course, apply the basic principles involved, and express them intelligibly.</li>
    <li><strong>D.</strong>  A student who is deficient in some degree in any of the areas that are characteristic of a C grade will earn a D.</li>
    <li><strong>F.</strong>  The student has failed to show mastery of the basic subject matter for the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>The grades of A-, B+, B-, C+, C-, D+, D- are used to indicate that a student has shown more or less than the usual competency required    for that grade.</p>
<p>Any work that receives a grade of less than a C may revised within two weeks of the      student receiving her/his grade.         If a work receives a grade of less than a C because it was originally turned in after its  due date (it was late), it may not be revised.</p>
<p>Cheating of any kind in this class will result in you being dropped    from the class, a grade of &ldquo;F&rdquo; recorded as your final grade, and your name forwarded    to the Dean and to the Center for Advising and Academic Services. Helping each other understand what to do and how to do it is not cheating. Getting advice is not cheating. <em>Doing someone else's work for them, borrowing someone else's work, or having work done for you</em> is always cheating, in this class and pretty much everywhere else in the world.</p>
<h2>Disability support</h2>
Students with disabilities who believe they may need  accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the Office  of Special Services at 575-3274, Donnelly Hall 226, or via email at  specserv@marist.edu as soon as possible to better ensure that such  accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.
<h2>Cell Phone Policy</h2>
To help you and everyone around you concentrate, cell phone ringers and vibrations are to remain OFF during class, as they would in a professional office. Please refrain from texting, calling, or answering texts or calls in class.    <br />
(I thought about saying &quot;go ahead and text anyone who can give you technical assistance on an assignment you're having trouble with in lab,&quot; because we'll all be giving each other help in class anyway, but for two reasons I think this is a bad idea: one, I don't want to interrupt anyone ELSE'S class, and two, it's important that we share and build on the expertise in this class. Here's a rough priority list of how you should seek help in class:
<ol>
    <li>Use a knowledgebase (forum, help page, manual) for the software you're using</li>
    <li>Do a Web search for the problem you're having</li>
    <li>Open the question up to the class</li>

<h2>ATTENDANCE POLICY</h2>
<p>Attendance and punctuality are required. <!-- It is each student&rsquo;s responsibility to sign the attendance sheet during every      class. <strong>Failure to sign the sheet will result in an absence being recorded for that day.</strong> If someone else signs in for      you, you will both lose three points from your final grade.  If the person who signs in for you admits to her/his misdeed,    then only one point will be deducted from your grade and her/his grade.</p>
<p> -->Every student will be allowed to miss two classes      for any reason without a penalty.  There are no excused or unexcused absences.<strong> Every absence after the first two        absences will result in three points being deducted from the student&rsquo;s final grade.</strong></p>
<p>Arriving late and/or leaving early is unacceptable.  You miss out on what we're learning, and it distracts all of us.       Do not arrive late to class or leave class early.       <strong>Every tardy or early departure will result in one point being deducted from your final grade.  </strong></p>
