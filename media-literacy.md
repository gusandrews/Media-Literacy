Class participation will account for the remaining 10% of your grade.

### Media panics (1 page, due Thursday, August 30)

**What do the "media panics" we're reading about have in common?** Gerbner
said "The usual question ‚Äì "Does television violence incite real-life
violence?" ‚Äì is itself a symptom rather than diagnostic tool of the problem."
What might he have said was "the usual question" about medieval writing, the
alphabet, comic books, Google, and Sesame Street? What do you think people's
concerns about these media products were "symptoms" of?


### Gee definitions exercise (digital worksheet on wiki, due Monday, September
10)

**This assignment will probably be easier if you provide examples of something
in the media that YOU are a fan of. But if you're uncomfortable sharing, you
can describe someone else and the media they are a fan of.**

**Copy and paste these questions on your own wiki page. Write your answers
between the questions, _as full sentences,_ formatting the questions
differently and using line spacing to be sure everything is readable.**

Give me a tour of a SEMIOTIC DOMAIN and an IDENTITY related to a movie, band,
show, broadcast event, book, comic, website, game, or other media "text." Use
examples from the Internet.

What SEMIOTIC DOMAIN are you going to be talking about?

Link to a site which relates to this semiotic domain.

Remember that a specific semiotic domain is different from "general
knowledge."

Give me an example of an IDENTITY a person might take on to be a part of this
semiotic domain.

Then give me an example of an IDENTITY that person might have elsewhere in
their life which might conflict with their identity in that semiotic domain.

Why might these two identities conflict?

Give me an example of an AFFINITY GROUP within this semiotic domain.

Link to or post two VISUAL things that you/this person would need to be able
to "read" to participate in the literacy specific to this domain. (Be
specific: this should either be links to image files like .jpg or .png; if
you're linking to a whole page, you need to tell me which visual element you
are referring to.)

For each one:

What does the "reader" need to know to interpret these visual elements within
this specific domain?

How is the SITUATED MEANING of this visual element different in this domain
than in another domain?

Give two examples of DESIGN GRAMMAR elements that you/this person need to know
to be LITERATE about this domain.

Link to something which relates to a SOCIAL PRACTICE specific to this domain.
In a couple of sentences, describe this social practice.

How is the SITUATED MEANING of this social practice seen differently by people
who do and do not participate in this domain?


### Technological determinism (3 page paper or 5 page script, due Monday,
September 17)

Innis and McLuhan believed that media had certain effects on individuals and
society. Which of the "media panics" we read about earlier assume the same or
similar effects? Given his critique of Innis's and McLuhan's work, what would
Carey say about these panics?

You have three options for writing this:

  * Option 1: write it as a traditional paper; 3 pages.

  * Option 2: write it as a script for a five-minute episode of The Media
Show, using Weena, Erna, the Intern, and other characters as you see fit; 5
pages.

  * Option 3: write it as a script for your own five-minute video; 5 pages.

**IF YOU ARE WRITING A SCRIPT**: Be sure to specify how you will use visual
elements to demonstrate the points you are making. Video is a visual medium;
there's no point in using it if you're just going to have someone lecturing to
the camera! (Yeah, I know. I am bad at following this advice myself.) See the
example script if you need some guidance on how to include visuals.

Recommended scriptwriting software: [Celtx][6] (it's free!)

### Group scholarly article critique (about 5 pages, on wiki; due Monday, October
1)

This project counts as your midterm (I'm scheduling it a little early so you
don't have all your midterms the same week.)

**Group 1: **read Kalin 1997 Television, Violence, and Children (pp 1-9 and
bibliography)

**Group 2: **read Children and the perceived reality of television (pp 86-96)

**Group 3: **read A Process-PFL Approach to Learning in Video Games (10 pp)

**All groups:** read Ten things wrong with media effects (9 pp)

Monday the 24th: we will set groups in class. You may want to communicate with
your group members while doing the reading before the next class.

Thursday the 27th (in class): **With your group, develop a critique of the
article you read, addressing these questions:**

  * What would the people we have read to date (Gee, Innis, McLuhan, Gerbner,
scholars mentioned by Sardar and Hobbs, Prandstraller, Jenkins, and Gauntlett)
say about the claims made in this article, and why?

  * These articles make scientific claims, using statistics and evidence from
experiments. How valid do you think they are? (This is sort of a "what's wrong
with this picture?" assignment.) In addition to drawing on the theories we
have read so far,** each member of your group should identify one decision**
made by the researchers which could compromise the scientific results of their
study. Some options might be the number of children studied, the ways they
gathered their data, or the way they framed their research question, but other
decisions are also fair game.

Between classes, continue to write your group's critique. Post it on the wiki.

Monday, October 1: Groups will present their critiques in class.

### Fan production (1 page, due Thursday, October 15)

Online, find an example of a fan community which has created its own work --
writing, art, video, etc -- based on a mass media property.

Places to start looking for fan works (but anywhere you find one is fine):

  * DeviantArt

  * Know Your Meme

  * Fanfiction.net

  * TVTropes

  * YouTube

On the wiki, link to it (post it if it is an image, embed it if it is a
video).

Briefly say something about what you think the original message of the media
property is, as well as the intended original audience.

Describe who you think the new audience of the "repurposed" text is (age?
gender? race? class? education level?).

Answer these questions in your writing:

How have the fans "subverted" the original message, or if you don't think they
have, why would you say they have not?

Think back to Jim Gee's writing on video games and affinity groups, and
Prandstraller's article on fans writing about U2. Would you say, like they do,
that these fans are "active consumers" who are creating new meanings? Why or
why not?

### New vs old media assignment (5 page paper or 7 page script, due Monday,
October 22)

So now we've talked about how digital media differ from traditional
conceptions of "mass" media. As Shirky points out, many of our societal
assumptions about how the media work are still carried over from the age of
mass media. For this assignment, I want you to think about the interactions of
new and old media.

Please compare the descriptions of new digital and old mass media from Shirky
and McQuail to support your arguments.

Pick one of these topics:

  1. Ideas about what mass media do shape the critiques of representation of
race, class, gender, ability, and other social groups ("affinity groups"?)
that have been made for many years. In what ways have media environments and
audiences changed that requires a change in critiques of representation? In
what ways have things stayed the same? (Please address both questions.)

  2. Think back to the "media effects" research and critiques we read
earlier-- the studies of children and television, and the Gerbner and
Gauntlett articles. In a digitally-mediated society, what has changed that
supports or detracts from these assumptions about how media influence people?

  3. Mass media and digital media exist side by side these days. Both Shirky
and McQuail present claims about the effects of the shape of new and old
media; so did McLuhan and Innis. How are technological determinist claims made
by Shirky, McQuail, McLuhan, and Innis supported by or undermined by the
interactions of new and old media?

You have three options for writing this:

  * Option 1: write it as a traditional paper; 5 pages.

  * Option 2: write it as a script for a five-minute episode of The Media
Show, using Weena, Erna, the Intern, and other characters as you see fit; 7
pages.

  * Option 3: write it as a script for your own five-minute video; 7 pages.

**IF YOU ARE WRITING A SCRIPT**: Be sure to specify how you will use visual
elements to demonstrate the points you are making. Video is a visual medium;
there's no point in using it if you're just going to have someone lecturing to
the camera! (Yeah, I know. I am bad at following this advice myself.) See the
example script if you need some guidance on how to include visuals.

Recommended scriptwriting software: [Celtx][6] (it's free!)

### Shirky and Fallows (3 pages, due Thursday, November 1)

Shirky writes, "in some cases the change that threatens the profession
benefits society... even in these situations the professionals can be relied
upon to care more about self-defense than about progress. What was once a
service has become a bottleneck."

Describe three "bottlenecks" that Fallows described in the 1990s which Shirky
says have been addressed by the rise of digital media and their affordances.
In your conclusion, discuss whether you think Shirky is correct in concluding
that digital reporting has changed these problems.

### Screencast (due Monday, November 19)

Using software like [Jing][7], [Camtasia][8], [Fraps][9], [HyperCam][10], or
[iShowU][11], do a walkthrough of a site that you use regularly.

Navigate through and show the following elements of the website, and evaluate
the following in your voiceover:

  * Identifying the site. Who is involved in creating, editing, and moderating
the content on this site? How do you know? How easy or hard is it to tell?
Visit the site About page (if there is one, or talk about the lack of an About
page if there isn't.)

  * Do a WhoiIs lookup of the site's address, and talk about what you find.
Also interpret the site address: what does it tell you about the site?

  * Advertising. What does the advertising on this site (or lack of it) tell
you about the intended audience for this site? About yourself as an audience?

  * Robot-readable elements. Which elements are there more for search engines
to read than for human users?

  * Privacy features. Do you feel this site adequately considers users'
privacy? Why or why not?

  * Name conventions. How does this site ask users to identify themselves -
with real names? Nicknames? Do they need to give financial or geographic
information to sign up?

### Videos, scripts, and storyboards (due December 10)

What take on the media that you learned in this class is, in your opinion, the
most important for others to know? How would you communicate it to someone
else? The final project will be

### Revision to one earlier assignment (due December 13)

Revising is an important part of writing (or editing video, or producing ads
or websites or just about any other media) in professional settings. Pick an
assignment from this course (not one of the one-page assignments) that you
would like to do better on. Consult with me about what might need improvement.
Then turn in your revisions by the last day of class.
