**Office: LT 226

Office hours: Tuesdays noon-3:00,

Online office hours: Wednesdays 2:30-5:30. Online location to be announced.**

## Key words:

media studies, digital literacies, new literacy, semiotics, new media,
communication theory, media ecology

## Description

Media Literacy is an introduction to the ways media influences its own future
as well as our own. This course will help students become more critical of our
media environment and more effective communicators of ideas, perspectives, and
knowledge. Media Literacy comprises film, television, radio, the Web, and
digital games. As both consumers and producers of media, we will analyze and
make sense of the myriad ways that media informs, obscures, propagates, sells,
and makes whole our sense of individuality and community. Topics include
visual signification, digital media, the social functions of the image, and
the role of media in the cultural process.

## Goals and objectives

Students will:

  * Confront and assess their own preconceived ideas about media, technology,
and literacy;

  * Distinguish between the affordances of different media;

  * Understand relationships between technical and meaning-creating practices;

  * Develop a language for media technology and signification;

  * Understand how media technologies interact with identity;

  * Be able to articulate cultural and political implications of
communication, with attention to concerns of power and equity.

## GRADING

  * **A.** An A student is one who, in addition to all the qualities
manifested by a B student, seeks mastery of a special field; s/he has
initiative and originality in attacking and solving problems; s/he shows
ability in rethinking problems, making associations, and adapting to new and
changing situations; moreover, s/ he has an appropriate vocabulary at his or
her command.

  * **B.** To earn a B grade a student must manifest all the qualities
characteristic of a C student and in addition be able to demonstrate skills
beyond the basic elements of the course; s/he has a more personal grasp of the
principles of the course and perceives wider application of them. The student
should be able to discuss the subject matter of the course with ease.

  * **C.** To earn a C grade a student must be able to demonstrate the basic
skills of a course, understand the essential background and materials of a
course, apply the basic principles involved, and express them intelligibly.

  * **D.** A student who is deficient in some degree in any of the areas that
are characteristic of a C grade will earn a D.

  * **F.** The student has failed to show mastery of the basic subject matter
for the course.

The grades of A-, B+, B-, C+, C-, D+, D- are used to indicate that a student
has shown more or less than the usual competency required for that grade.

## Disability support

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this
class are encouraged to contact the Office of Special Services at 575-3274,
Donnelly Hall 226, or via email at specserv@marist.edu as soon as possible to
better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

## Cell Phone Policy

To help you and everyone around you concentrate, cell phone ringers and
vibrations are to remain OFF during class, as they would in a professional
office. Please refrain from texting, calling, or answering texts or calls in
class.

## ATTENDANCE POLICY

Attendance and punctuality are required. It is each student's responsibility
to sign the attendance sheet during every class. **Failure to sign the sheet
will result in an absence being recorded for that day.** If someone else signs
in for you, you will both lose three points from your final grade. If the
person who signs in for you admits to her/his misdeed, then only one point
will be deducted from your grade and her/his grade.

Every student will be allowed to miss two classes for any reason without a
penalty. There are no excused or unexcused absences.** Every absence after the
first two absences will result in three points being deducted from the
student's final grade.**

Arriving late and/or leaving early is unacceptable. You miss out on what we're
learning, and it distracts all of us. Do not arrive late to class or leave
class early. **Every tardy or early departure will result in one point being
deducted from your final grade. **

## How to Do Well in This Class

  * Attend all classes and participate constructively, i.e. answer questions,
ask questions, and offer helpful suggestions for others' works.

  * Do not cheat on any assignment.

  * Do not spam the instructor with any kind of communication, be it voice,
text, video, or direct messages in Second Life. (Particularly not direct
messages in Second Life, I'm almost never there anymore.)

WRITE:

From "The Seven Great Debates in the Media Literacy Movement" (Renee Hobbs,
1998:

"At the 1993 Media Literacy National Leadership Conference, U.S. educators
could not agree on the range of appropriate goals for media education, or the
scope of appropriate instructional techniques, but they did identify the
following concepts, based on models developed by British, Australian and
Canadian

educators that should be included in the analysis of media messages:

  1. media messages are constructed

  2. media messages are produced within economic, social, political,
historical and aesthetic contexts

  3. the interpretative meaning-making processes involved in message reception
consists of an interaction between the reader, the text and the culture

  4. media have are unique 'languages,' characteristics which typify various
forms, genres and symbol systems of communication

  5. media representations play a role in people's understanding of social
reality"


Match each of Renee Hobbs's outline points to a media theory mentioned in what
you've read so far in Introducing Media Studies. There may be more than one
theory matched to more than of her numbered points, and vice versa. Send your
answers in to me via iLearn.

Session 11, Thursday, October 4:

**What are "Mass Media?"**

Many of the critiques of the effects of media come from the era of _mass
media_ -- when there was less broadcast media and film content available,
there were fewer channels, and any given media property was much more likely
to reach a sizeable percentage of the population. How did this landscape
effect what got made -- and how people thought about the effects of media?

Session 13, Thursday, October 11:

**Making The Media: Representation**

One thing that just about all media scholars agree is that the media do not
reflect reality "as it is" -- because they are created by people, they always
represent some particular take on reality. You may have heard criticism of how
media represent women or people of color, or how they glorify criminals... but
have you thought about how they represent rich and poor people, people with
disabilities, different professions, or sports? In the next few classes we
will explore representation, and how it interacts with advertisers' plans to
reach audiences.

**Making The Media: Audiences and Representation**

And, of course, new media have also transformed the meanings and contexts of
representations. The Cluetrain Manifesto was produced by a couple of guys in

realizing how the Internet might change the relationship between consumer
audiences and advertisers.

Session 15, Thursday, October 18:

**Making The Media: Commercial constraints**


Advertising may seem like an annoying interruption to the media we actually
want to be "reading." But in fact, it shapes the media in fundamental ways. We
transition from discussing how media makers' conceptions of audiences interact
with their representations, to discussing how advertising funding shapes those
audiences, and ultimately shapes the media we see.

**Identification and Trust**

By now I hope you agree that it is important to understand what goes into
making a media text, in order to evaluate the quality of its contents. How far
can this go? Most of us know we should evaluate the quality of information on
Wikipedia, but why? How often can we investigate the sources of what we read?
Do we always have to evaluate the quality of news reporting? Of textbooks? How
often? How do digital sources change what we need to know?

### Media panics (1 page, due Thursday, August 30)

**What do the "media panics" we're reading about have in common?** Gerbner
said "The usual question - "Does television violence incite real-life
violence?" - is itself a symptom rather than diagnostic tool of the problem."
What might he have said was "the usual question" about medieval writing, the
alphabet, comic books, Google, and Sesame Street? What do you think people's
concerns about these media products were "symptoms" of?


### Gee definitions exercise (digital worksheet on wiki, due Monday, September
10)

**This assignment will probably be easier if you provide examples of something
in the media that YOU are a fan of. But if you're uncomfortable sharing, you
can describe someone else and the media they are a fan of.**

**Copy and paste these questions on your own wiki page. Write your answers
between the questions, _as full sentences,_ formatting the questions
differently and using line spacing to be sure everything is readable.**

Give me a tour of a SEMIOTIC DOMAIN and an IDENTITY related to a movie, band,
show, broadcast event, book, comic, website, game, or other media "text." Use
examples from the Internet.

What SEMIOTIC DOMAIN are you going to be talking about?

Link to a site which relates to this semiotic domain.

Remember that a specific semiotic domain is different from "general
knowledge."

Give me an example of an IDENTITY a person might take on to be a part of this
semiotic domain.

Then give me an example of an IDENTITY that person might have elsewhere in
their life which might conflict with their identity in that semiotic domain.

Why might these two identities conflict?

Give me an example of an AFFINITY GROUP within this semiotic domain.

Link to or post two VISUAL things that you/this person would need to be able
to "read" to participate in the literacy specific to this domain. (Be
specific: this should either be links to image files like .jpg or .png; if
you're linking to a whole page, you need to tell me which visual element you
are referring to.)

For each one:

What does the "reader" need to know to interpret these visual elements within
this specific domain?

How is the SITUATED MEANING of this visual element different in this domain
than in another domain?

Give two examples of DESIGN GRAMMAR elements that you/this person need to know
to be LITERATE about this domain.

Link to something which relates to a SOCIAL PRACTICE specific to this domain.
In a couple of sentences, describe this social practice.

How is the SITUATED MEANING of this social practice seen differently by people
who do and do not participate in this domain?


### Technological determinism (3 page paper or 5 page script, due Monday,
September 17)

Innis and McLuhan believed that media had certain effects on individuals and
society. Which of the "media panics" we read about earlier assume the same or
similar effects? Given his critique of Innis's and McLuhan's work, what would
Carey say about these panics?

You have three options for writing this:

  * Option 1: write it as a traditional paper; 3 pages.

  * Option 2: write it as a script for a five-minute episode of The Media
Show, using Weena, Erna, the Intern, and other characters as you see fit; 5
pages.

  * Option 3: write it as a script for your own five-minute video; 5 pages.

**IF YOU ARE WRITING A SCRIPT**: Be sure to specify how you will use visual
elements to demonstrate the points you are making. Video is a visual medium;
there's no point in using it if you're just going to have someone lecturing to
the camera! (Yeah, I know. I am bad at following this advice myself.) See the
example script if you need some guidance on how to include visuals.

Recommended scriptwriting software: [Celtx][16] (it's free!)

###

Group scholarly article critique (about 5 pages, on wiki; due Monday, October
1)

This project counts as your midterm (I'm scheduling it a little early so you
don't have all your midterms the same week.)

**Group 1: **read Kalin 1997 Television, Violence, and Children (pp 1-9 and
bibliography)

**Group 2: **read Children and the perceived reality of television (pp 86-96)

**Group 3: **read A Process-PFL Approach to Learning in Video Games (10 pp)

**All groups:** read Ten things wrong with media effects (9 pp)

Monday the 24th: we will set groups in class. You may want to communicate with
your group members while doing the reading before the next class.

Thursday the 27th (in class): **With your group, develop a critique of the
article you read, addressing these questions:**

  * What would the people we have read to date (Gee, Innis, McLuhan, Gerbner,
scholars mentioned by Sardar and Hobbs, Prandstraller, Jenkins, and Gauntlett)
say about the claims made in this article, and why?

  * These articles make scientific claims, using statistics and evidence from
experiments. How valid do you think they are? (This is sort of a "what's wrong
with this picture?" assignment.) In addition to drawing on the theories we
have read so far,** each member of your group should identify one decision**
made by the researchers which could compromise the scientific results of their
study. Some options might be the number of children studied, the ways they
gathered their data, or the way they framed their research question, but other
decisions are also fair game.

Between classes, continue to write your group's critique. Post it on the wiki.

Monday, October 1: Groups will present their critiques in class.

###

Fan production (1 page, due Thursday, October 15)

Online, find an example of a fan community which has created its own work --
writing, art, video, etc -- based on a mass media property.

Places to start looking for fan works (but anywhere you find one is fine):

  * DeviantArt

  * Know Your Meme

  * Fanfiction.net

  * TVTropes

  * YouTube

On the wiki, link to it (post it if it is an image, embed it if it is a
video).

Briefly say something about what you think the original message of the media
property is, as well as the intended original audience.

Describe who you think the new audience of the "repurposed" text is (age?
gender? race? class? education level?).

Answer these questions in your writing:

How have the fans "subverted" the original message, or if you don't think they
have, why would you say they have not?

Think back to Jim Gee's writing on video games and affinity groups, and
Prandstraller's article on fans writing about U2. Would you say, like they do,
that these fans are "active consumers" who are creating new meanings? Why or
why not?

###

New vs old media assignment (5 page paper or 7 page script, due Monday,
October 22)

So now we've talked about how digital media differ from traditional
conceptions of "mass" media. As Shirky points out, many of our societal
assumptions about how the media work are still carried over from the age of
mass media. For this assignment, I want you to think about the interactions of
new and old media.

Please compare the descriptions of new digital and old mass media from Shirky
and McQuail to support your arguments.

Pick one of these topics:

  1. Ideas about what mass media do shape the critiques of representation of
race, class, gender, ability, and other social groups ("affinity groups"?)
that have been made for many years. In what ways have media environments and
audiences changed that requires a change in critiques of representation? In
what ways have things stayed the same? (Please address both questions.)

  2. Think back to the "media effects" research and critiques we read
earlier-- the studies of children and television, and the Gerbner and
Gauntlett articles. In a digitally-mediated society, what has changed that
supports or detracts from these assumptions about how media influence people?

  3. Mass media and digital media exist side by side these days. Both Shirky
and McQuail present claims about the effects of the shape of new and old
media; so did McLuhan and Innis. How are technological determinist claims made
by Shirky, McQuail, McLuhan, and Innis supported by or undermined by the
interactions of new and old media?

You have three options for writing this:

  * Option 1: write it as a traditional paper; 5 pages.

  * Option 2: write it as a script for a five-minute episode of The Media
Show, using Weena, Erna, the Intern, and other characters as you see fit; 7
pages.

  * Option 3: write it as a script for your own five-minute video; 7 pages.

**IF YOU ARE WRITING A SCRIPT**: Be sure to specify how you will use visual
elements to demonstrate the points you are making. Video is a visual medium;
there's no point in using it if you're just going to have someone lecturing to
the camera! (Yeah, I know. I am bad at following this advice myself.) See the
example script if you need some guidance on how to include visuals.

Recommended scriptwriting software: [Celtx][16] (it's free!)

###

Shirky and Fallows (3 pages, due Thursday, November 1)

Shirky writes, "in some cases the change that threatens the profession
benefits society... even in these situations the professionals can be relied
upon to care more about self-defense than about progress. What was once a
service has become a bottleneck."

Describe three "bottlenecks" that Fallows described in the 1990s which Shirky
says have been addressed by the rise of digital media and their affordances.
In your conclusion, discuss whether you think Shirky is correct in concluding
that digital reporting has changed these problems.

###

Screencast (due Monday, November 19)

Using software like [Jing][17], [Camtasia][18], [Fraps][19], [HyperCam][20],
or [iShowU][21], do a walkthrough of a site that you use regularly.

Navigate through and show the following elements of the website, and evaluate
the following in your voiceover:

  * Identifying the site. Who is involved in creating, editing, and moderating
the content on this site? How do you know? How easy or hard is it to tell?
Visit the site About page (if there is one, or talk about the lack of an About
page if there isn't.)

  * Do a WhoiIs lookup of the site's address, and talk about what you find.
Also interpret the site address: what does it tell you about the site?

  * Advertising. What does the advertising on this site (or lack of it) tell
you about the intended audience for this site? About yourself as an audience?

Videos, scripts, and storyboards (due December 10)

What idea that you learned in this class is, in your opinion, the most
important for others to know about the media and how we think about them? How
would you communicate it to someone else? The final project will be producing
a three-minute video communicating an idea from the class to other students.
You will work in teams of two to produce the videos. One option is to revise
and produce one of the scripts you wrote earlier in the class; or, you can
develop a new script for this project. I will meet with each team to
"greenlight" and help you plan your ideas, helping make sure they'll satisfy
the course requirement and that you're not trying to make something too big
for a final project.

As I said earlier: Be sure to specify in your script how you will use visual
elements to demonstrate the points you are making. Video is a visual medium;
there's no point in using it if you're just going to have someone lecturing to
the camera! (Yeah, I know. I am bad at following this advice myself.) See the
example script if you need some guidance on how to include visuals.

In addition to developing a **script** you will also develop a **storyboard**
to plan the shots for your video. We will **workshop** both of these in class
before the due date. We may also workshop your **rough cuts** so you have a
chance to improve your videos before the final presentation.

Revision to one earlier assignment (due December 13)

Revising is an important part of writing (or editing video, or producing ads
or websites or just about any other media) in professional settings. Pick an
assignment from this course (not one of the one-page assignments) that you
would like to do better on. Consult with me about what might need improvement.
Then turn in your revisions by the last day of class.
