    Before we get started on this course, it's a good idea to come to an agreement of what we mean when we say &quot;media.&quot; What's included, and what's not included? What do media do for individuals, and in society?<br />
    And when we say someone is &quot;media literate,&quot; what does that mean? Why do we call it &quot;literacy&quot; when people aren't reading words?<br />
